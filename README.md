  --secondary-color: #764ba2;
  --accent-color: #ffd700;
  --text-color: #333;
  --background-color: #f8f9fa;
}
```

## üîê Security Considerations

2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select source branch (usually `main`)
4. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

### Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command to empty (static site)
3. Set publish directory to root (`/`)
4. Deploy automatically on commits

### Custom Domain
